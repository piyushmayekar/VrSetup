  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment \n\nTo cut the straight line on M.S. Plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\n Wear PPE Kit.",
    "Step 2\n\n Keep raw material ready as per the given drawing.",
    "Step 3\n\n Keep the job on the Cutting table in flat position.",
    "Step 4\n\n Clean the job surface with wire brush and remove burrs by filing.",
    "Step 5\n\n As per the drawing, the surfaces of the job should be marked and punched.",
    
    "Step 6\n\n Cracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 7\n\n Fix regulators on both the cylinders.\nFits the regulators for the Right-handed threads run clockwise, and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.",   
    "Step 8.1\n\n Fix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.",   
    "Step 8.2\n\n Fix hose pipe on both the regulators",
    "Step 8.3\n\n Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.",
    "Step 8.4\n\n Fix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch",
    "Step 9\n\n Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2)",
    "Step 10.1\n\n Check leakage if any.",
    "Step 10.2\n\n Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 11\n\n Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",

    "Step 12\n\n Keep the gas cutting torch (blow pipe) at 90Â° on job surface and the cutting line.",
    "Step 13\n\n Heat one end of the marking line till it turns cherry red. Keep a distance of 5mm between the job and the nozzle",

    "Step 14\n\n Press oxygen lever and slowly proceed in the direction of cutting", 
    "Step 15.1\n\n Turning off Flame",

    "Step 15.2\n\n Now close both the gas cylinder valves.",
    "Step 16\n\n Pick up C.S. brush and clean the surface."
