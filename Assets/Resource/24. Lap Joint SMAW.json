  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment no. 24 - SMAW Lap Joint\n\nAIM - Welding on lap joint MS plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates. Required Measurements-150 x 50 x 10 mm.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions on points on the line.",
    "Step 3.1\n\nWear PPE Kit.",
    "Step 4.1\n\nSet the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2).",
    "Step 4.2\n\nOpen acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 4.3\n\nKeep the gas cutting torch (blow pipe) at 90Â° on job surface and the cutting line. Heat one end of the marking line till it turns cherry red. Keep a distance of 5mm between the job and the nozzle",
    "Step 4.4\n\nTurning off Flame.", 
    "Step 5\n\nTake the two plates to the welding table, place one in the designated position, then place the stands besides it. Do the scriber marking at 20 mm position. Place the second plate on top of it after. Refer sketch image.",
    "Step 6\n\nAttach a 3.15mm electrode to the welding machine & do the tag welding on both sides.",
    "Step 7\n\nPerform the root run welding. Clean up the slag with Chipping Hammer & Wire Brush. Repeat the process on the other side.",
    "Step 8\n\nSet the current to 130A & perform the first run welding. Clean up the slag with Chipping Hammer & Wire Brush. Repeat the process on the other side.",
    "Step 9\n\nAttach a 4mm electrode to the welding machine & set the current to 160A. Perform the second run welding. Clean up the slag with Chipping Hammer & Wire Brush. Repeat the process on the other side."
