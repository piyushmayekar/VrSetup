  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates wrt. 150 x 100 x 10mm.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions on points on the line.",
    "Step 3.1\n\nWear PPE Kit.",
    "Step 4.1\n\nSet the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2).",
    "Step 4.2\n\nOpen acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 4.3\n\nKeep the gas cutting torch (blow pipe) at 90° on job surface and the cutting line. Heat one end of the marking line till it turns cherry red. Keep a distance of 5mm between the job and the nozzle",
    "Step 4.4\n\nTurning off Flame.",
    "Step 5\n\nLook at the calculation on the tooltable for the bevel cutting. Grab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
