  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\n Wear PPE Kit",
    "Step 2\n\n Tie oxygen and acetylene gas cylinder on the trolley with chain.",
    "Step 3\n\n Cracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 4\n\n Fix regulators on both the cylinders.",   
    "Step 5.1\n\n Fix flashback arrestor on both the regulators.",
   
    "Step 5.2\n\n Fix hose pipe on both the regulators",
 "Step 5.3\n\n Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas.",
    "Step 5.4\n\n Connect welding torch.",
    "Step 6\n\n Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.",
    "Step 7.1\n\n Check leakage in acetylene gas cylinder with soap water solution.",
    "Step 7.2\n\n Check leakage of oxygen connection with normal water.",
    "Step 7.3\n\n Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 8\n\n Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 9.1\n\n Flame Setting.",
    "Step 9.2\n\n Reducing or Carburizing Excess acetylene(0.9:1) (Allow steels and aluminium alloys)",
    "Step 9.3\n\n Oxidizing Excess oxygen (1.5:1) (Brasses,Bronzes,copper)",
    "Step 9.4\n\n Neutral Equal accetylene & oxygen(low carbon steel,mild steels)",
    "Step 10.1\n\n Turning off Flame.\nNow, to turn off the flame first close acetylene control valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve",
    "Step 10.2\n\n Now close both the gas cylinder valves.\nCheck zero reading on both the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder."
