  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment No. 23 - SMAW T-joint welding\n\nAIM - To make T-Joint on MS Plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates wrt. 150 x 100 x 10mm.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions on points on the line.",
    "Step 3.1\n\nWear PPE Kit.",
    "Step 4.1\n\nSet the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2).",
    "Step 4.2\n\nOpen acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 4.3\n\nKeep the gas cutting torch (blow pipe) at 90Â° on job surface and the cutting line. Heat one end of the marking line till it turns cherry red. Keep a distance of 5mm between the job and the nozzle",
    "Step 4.4\n\nTurning off Flame.",  
    "Step 5\n\nPlace one job plate on the welding table in horizontal position. Do the scriber marking for the vertical position plate & place the plate in the designated spot. Check whether the angle between them is a right angle with the try square.",
    "Step 7\n\nAttach a 3.15mm electrode to the welding machine & do the tack welding. Check whether the angles between the plates is a right angle with a try square.",
    "Step 8\n\nSet the current at 130A & do the root welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 9\n\nAttach the 4.0mm electrode & set the current at 170A. After that, do the cover run welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush"
