  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment No. 21 - SMAW Corner Joint\n\nAIM - To make a fillet weld outside a corner on a M.S. plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates wrt. 150 x 100 x 10mm.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions on points on the line.",
    "Step 3.1\n\nWear PPE Kit.",
    "Step 4.1\n\nSet the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2).",
    "Step 4.2\n\nOpen acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 4.3\n\nKeep the gas cutting torch (blow pipe) at 90Â° on job surface and the cutting line. Heat one end of the marking line till it turns cherry red. Keep a distance of 5mm between the job and the nozzle",
    "Step 4.4\n\nTurning off Flame.",
    "Step 5\n\nGrab the 2 Job Plates & take them to the welding table. Place a job plate in flat position, then place the spacers in position. Then place the other job plate in the vertical position.",
    "Step 6\n\nAttach a 3.15mm electrode to the welding machine & do the tag welding. Remove the spacers after tacking is done.",
    "Step 7\n\nPlace the plates in the upright position & set the current at 110A",
    "Step 8\n\nDo the root welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 9\n\nPlace a 4mm electrode on the welding machine. Set the current at 116A. After that, do the second run welding in the specified weaving pattern. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 10\n\nPerform the third run welding in the specified weaving pattern. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush"
