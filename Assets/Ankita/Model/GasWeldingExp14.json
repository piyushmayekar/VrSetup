  "Steps": [
    "Step 5\n\n Tie oxygen and acetylene gas cylinder on the trolley with chain.",
    "Step 6\n\n Cracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 7\n\n Fix regulators on both the cylinders.\nFits the regulators for the Right-handed threads run clockwise, and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.",   
    "Step 8.1\n\n Fix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.",
   
    "Step 8.2\n\n Fix hose pipe on both the regulators",
    "Step 8.3\n\n Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.",
    "Step 8.4\n\n Fix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch",
    "Step 9\n\n Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.",
    "Step 10.1\n\n Check leakage in acetylene gas cylinder with soap water solution.",
    "Step 10.2\n\n Check leakage of oxygen connection with normal water.",
    "Step 10.3\n\n Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 11\n\n Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 12.1\n\n Flame Setting.",
    "Step 12.2\n\n Reducing or Carburizing Excess acetylene(0.9:1) (Allow steels and aluminium alloys)",
    "Step 12.3\n\n Oxidizing Excess oxygen (1.5:1) (Brasses,Bronzes,copper)",
    "Step 12.4\n\n Neutral Equal accetylene & oxygen(low carbon steel,mild steels)",
    "Step 15.1\n\n Turning off Flame.\nNow, to turn off the flame first close acetylene control valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve",
    "Step 15.2\n\n Now close both the gas cylinder valves.\nCheck zero reading on both the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder."
