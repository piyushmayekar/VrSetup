  "Steps": [
    "Step 9\n\nTie oxygen and acetylene gas cylinder on the trolley with chain.",
    "Step 10\n\nCracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 11\n\nFix regulators on both the cylinders.\nFits the regulators for the Right-handed threads run clockwise, and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.",
    "Step 12.1\n\nFix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.",
   
    "Step 12.2\n\nFix hose pipe on both the regulators",
    "Step 12.3\n\nFix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.",
    "Step 12.4\n\nFix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch",
    "Step 13\n\nSet the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.",
    "Step 14.1\n\nCheck leakage in acetylene gas cylinder with soap water solution.",
    "Step 14.2\n\nCheck leakage of oxygen connection with normal water.",
    "Step 14.3\n\nFix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 15\n\nOpen acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 16.1\n\nFlame Setting.",
    "Step 16.2\n\nReducing or Carburizing Excess acetylene(0.9:1) (Allow steels and aluminium alloys)",
    "Step 16.3\n\nOxidizing Excess oxygen (1.5:1) (Brasses,Bronzes,copper)",
    "Step 16.4\n\nNeutral Equal accetylene & oxygen(low carbon steel,mild steels)",
    "Step 19.1\n\nTurning off Flame.\nNow, to turn off the flame first close acetylene control valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve",
    "Step 19.2\n\nNow close both the gas cylinder valves.\nCheck zero reading on both the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder."
