 {"ExperimentTitle": "Experiment \n\nGas Welding Fusion Run with filler rod",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\n Wear PPE Kit",
    "Step 2\n\n Clean the Job surface with wire brush and remove burrs.",
    "Step 3\n\n Keep the job at 90 degree and a root gap of 1.5mm.",
    "Step 6\n\n Cracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 7\n\n Fix regulators on both the cylinders.\nFits the regulators for the Right-handed threads run clockwise and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.",   
    "Step 8.1\n\n Fix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.",   
    "Step 8.2\n\n Fix hose pipe on both the regulators",
    "Step 8.3\n\n Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.",
    "Step 8.4\n\n Fix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch",
    "Step 9\n\n Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2)",
    "Step 10.1\n\n Check leakage if any.",
    "Step 10.2\n\n Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 11\n\n Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 12\n\n Flame Setting",
    "Step 13\n\n Set the alignment and start welding by leftward technique./nMake molten pool with blow pipe and use filler rod on molten pool.",	
    "Step 14\n\n Turning off Flame.\nNow to turn off the flame first close acetylene control valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve",
    "Step 14.1\n\n Now close both the gas cylinder valves.\nCheck zero reading on both the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder.",
    "Step 15\n\n Remove slag with chipping hammer and clean the welded part with wire brush"
