 {"ExperimentTitle": "Experiment \n\nGas Welding - To make Lap joint on MS Sheet(Flat Position)",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\n Wear PPE Kit",
    "Step 2\n\n Clean the Job surface with wire brush and remove burrs.",
    "Step 3\n\n Perform marking and punching on the job surface as per drawing.",
    "Step 4\n\n Keep the job on welding table in Flat Position.",
    "Step 5\n\n Cracking of both the cylinder",
    "Step 6\n\n Fix regulators on both the cylinders.\nFits the regulators for the Right-handed threads run clockwise and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.",   
    "Step 7.1\n\n Fix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.",   
    "Step 7.2\n\n Fix hose pipe on both the regulators",
    "Step 7.3\n\n Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.",
    "Step 7.4\n\n Fix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch",
    "Step 8\n\n Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2)",
    "Step 9.1\n\n Check leakage if any.",
    "Step 9.2\n\n Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.",
    "Step 10\n\n Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark lighter.",
    "Step 11\n\n Flame Setting",
    "Step 13\n\n With the help of MS filler rod of 1.6mm diameter, Do tack welding on both ends and center of job.",
    "Step 14\n\n With the help of tri square, check the alignment of the job and clean the tag weld.",
    "Step 15\n\n Start Welding by Leftward Technique.",	
    "Step 16\n\n Turning off Flame.\nNow to turn off the flame first close acetylene control valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve",
    "Step 16.1\n\n Now close both the gas cylinder valves.\nCheck zero reading on both the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder.",
    "Step 15\n\n Remove slag with chipping hammer and clean the welded part with wire brush"
