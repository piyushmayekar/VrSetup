  readSteps:
  - ExperimentTitle: Experiment Gas Welding - To make Lap joint on MS Sheet(Flat
      Position)
    Steps:
    - Step 1 Wear PPE Kit
    - Step 2 Clean the Job surface with wire brush and remove burrs.
    - Step 3 Perform marking and punching on the job surface as per drawing.
    - Step 4 Keep the job on welding table in Flat Position.
    - Step 5 Cracking of both the cylinder
    - Step 6 Fix regulators on both the cylinders.Fits the regulators for the Right-handed
      threads run clockwise and left-handed threads run counter clockwise.
    - Step 7.1 Fix flashback arrestor and Fix hose connector on both the regulators.
    - Step 7.2 Fix hose pipe on both the regulators
    - Step 7.3 Fix hose clip to avoid leakage of the gas at regulators.
    - Step 7.4 Fix hose connector and hose clip on welding torch
    - Step 8.1 Set the gas pressure on the regulator as per nozzle size.(Set pressure
      on regulator as 0.15 kg/cm2)
    - Step 8.2 Check leakage if any.
    - Step 9.1 Fix nozzle on Welding Torch.
    - Step 9.2 Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with
      spark lighter.
    - Step 10 With the help of MS filler rod of 1.6mm diameter, Do tack welding on
      both ends and centre of the job.
    - Step 11 With the help of tri square, check the alignment of the job and clean
      the tag weld.
    - Step 12 Start Welding by Leftward Technique.(Hold cutting torch and filler
      rod)
    - Step 13.1 Turning off Flame
    - Step 13.2 Now close both the gas cylinder valves.
    - Step 14 Pick up C.S. brush and clean the surface.
    - Step 15 Check the defects.

    - Step 10 Open acetylene control valve about 1/4th and light the flame with spark
      lighter.
    - Step 11 Flame Setting
    - Step 13 With the help of MS filler rod of 1.6mm diameter, Do tack welding on
      both ends and center of job.
    - Step 14 With the help of tri square, check the alignment of the job and clean
      the tag weld
    - Step 15 Start Welding by Leftward Technique.
    - Step 16 Turning off Flame.Now to turn off the flame first close acetylene control
      valve on blow pipe and then close oxygen control valve
    - Step 16.1 Now close both the gas cylinder valves.Check zero reading on both
      the pressure gauges attached on blow pipe as well as the gas cylinder.
    - Step 15 Remove slag with chipping hammer and clean the welded part with wire
      brush
