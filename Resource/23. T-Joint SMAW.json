  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment No. 23 - SMAW T-joint\n\nAIM - To make T-Joint on MS Plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates wrt. 150 x 100 x 10mm.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions points on the line.",
    "Step 4\n\nGrab both the jobs & fix them one by one on the mechanical vise & cut them with the hacksaw. File both the rough edges with a flat file..",   
    "Step 5\n\nPlace one job plate on the welding table in horizontal position. Do the scriber marking for the vertical position plate & place the plate in the designated spot. Check whether the angle between them is a right angle with the try square.",
    "Step 6\n\nWear The PPE Kit.",
    "Step 7\n\nAttach a 3.15mm electrode to the welding machine & do the tack welding. Check whether the angles between the plates is a right angle with a try square..",
    "Step 8\n\nPlace the plates in the upright position & set the current at 110A",
    "Step 9\n\nSet the current at 130A & do the root welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 10\n\nAttach the 4.0mm electrode & set the current at 170A. After that, do the cover run welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush"
