  "ExperimentTitle": "Experiment No. 21 - SMAW Corner Joint\n\nAIM - To make a fillet weld outside a corner on a M.S. plate",
  "Steps": [
    "Step 1\n\nGrab the steel ruler from the tool table & measure both the job plates wrt. 150 x 100 x 10mm.",
    "Step 2\n\nGrab the scriber & steel ruler & mark the extra parts on the job plates.",
    "Step 3\n\nGrab the Center Punch & Hammer & make impressions points on the line.",
    "Step 4\n\nGrab both the jobs & fix them one by one on the mechanical vise & cut them with the hacksaw. File both the rough edges with a flat file..",   
    "Step 5\n\nGrab the 2 Job Plates & take them to the welding table. Place a job plate in flat position, then place the spacers in position. Then place the other job plate in the vertical position.",
    "Step 6\n\nWear The PPE Kit.",
    "Step 7\n\nAttach a 3.15mm electrode to the welding machine & do the tag welding. Remove the spacers after tacking is done.",
    "Step 8\n\nPlace the plates in the upright position & set the current at 110A",
    "Step 9\n\nDo the root welding. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 10\n\nPlace a 4mm electrode on the welding machine. Set the current at 116A. After that, do the second run welding in the specified weaving pattern. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush",
    "Step 11\n\nPerform the third run welding in the specified weaving pattern. Clean up the slag with chipping hammer & wire brush"
